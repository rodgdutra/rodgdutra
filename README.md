 I am a machine learning engineer / AI developer with an MSc in electrical engineering specializing in signal processing via machine learning techniques. I have successfully published two research papers during my tenure as a Machine Learning Researcher at LASSE, focusing primarily on researching the use of AI in time series for synchronization in Telecommunications. After that, I joined the Automatic speech recognition team of SiDi as a Machine learning engineer, where I leveraged my expertise to develop, research, and enhance cutting-edge speech recognition models, delivering cutting-edge solutions for the company and its clients.
